n8n System Prompts Analysis and Improvements
I've reviewed all the prompt files in your n8n system and created the requested tutorial page. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

Analysis of Current Prompt System
Strengths
Well-structured multi-agent architecture with clear role separation
Detailed examples in Orchestrator and Slack prompts
Good keyword triggering mechanisms for routing requests
Clear multi-step operation handling guidelines
Areas for Improvement
Per Agent Improvements:
Orchestator Prompt:
Lengthy (16KB) with some redundancy
Could use better error handling for failed subagent responses
Lacks clear recovery strategies when subagents don't provide expected outputs
Mail Agent Prompt:
Needs clearer handling for Get_Emails tool failures
Parameter inference could be enhanced for edge cases
Slack Agent Prompt:
Rigid tool sequence with inadequate fallback if steps fail
Could use more examples of complex requests with fallbacks
Calendar Agent Prompt:
Significantly underdeveloped compared to others
Missing examples, comprehensive tools description, and error handling
Asana Agent Prompt:
Good JSON structure but complex for maintenance
Limited error recovery guidance
Agent Interconnection Improvements:
Implement standardized JSON response formats across all agents
Add explicit context preservation mechanisms when transferring between agents
Create clearer hand-off protocols for multi-step operations
Add verification steps for received data from other agents
Tool Confusion Prevention:
Add pre-execution tool validation steps
Standardize tool naming conventions (e.g., "Slack_GetChannels" instead of "Slack Get Channels")
Implement parameter validation before tool execution
Add explicit fallbacks when tools aren't available
Create clear error message templates for tool failures
Recommended Prompt Improvements
General Recommendations:
Common Formatting Structure - Use consistent sections across all prompts: Overview, Tools, Rules, Examples, Error Handling
Versioning System - Add version numbers to track prompt evolution
Tool Validation - Add pre-execution checks to verify tool availability
Specific Agent Improvements:
Orchestrator Agent:
Shorten and reorganize content into clearer sections
Add explicit handling for partial or failed responses from subagents
Enhance multi-step operation documentation with error recovery paths
Mail Agent:
Add explicit error handling for Get_Emails failures with user-friendly messages
Enhance parameter inference documentation with edge cases
Add more examples of processing complex email patterns
Slack Agent:
Add fallback strategies when tool sequence steps fail
More flexible channel naming conventions
Clearer integration examples with other agents
Calendar Agent:
Complete rewrite with comprehensive tool descriptions
Add detailed examples similar to other agents
Include proper error handling and tool selection guidelines
Asana Agent:
Add natural language processing capabilities to complement JSON structure
Enhance error handling with human-readable explanations
Add recovery strategies for failed operations
Tutorial Page
I've created a comprehensive tutorial.html file in your dashboard's public directory that:

Explains the n8n system architecture and agent roles
Describes the request flow and multi-step operations
Includes example scenarios and usage tips
Outlines system capabilities by service area
Maintains the dashboard's existing style and branding
